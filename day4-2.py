# Python3 code to demonstrate working of 
# Sort tuple list by Nth element of tuple 
# using sort() + lambda 
# initializing list 
test_list = [(4, 5, 1), (6, 1, 5), (7, 4, 2), (6, 2, 4)] 
# printing original list 
print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))
# index according to which sort to perform 

N = 1

# Sort tuple list by Nth element of tuple 
# using sort() + lambda 
test_list.sort(key = lambda x: x[N])  
# printing result  
print("List after sorting tuple by Nth index sort : " + str(test_list))
